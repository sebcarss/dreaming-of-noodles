This tasted amazing! There was a subtle sweetness from the mirin, a gentle saltiness from the soy sauce
and a warming kick from the rose harissa rayu that gave the broth a deliciousness. The pak choi was
steamed along with the leek and this lended a freshness to the dish so it wasn't too heavy for lunch.

- 2 pak choi leaves

- handful of leftover roast chicken

## Method

1. Cook it all up and eat it!
