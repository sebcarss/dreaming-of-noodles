## Ingredients

- 1 fillet Salmon, skin-on
- 1/2 Avocado, sliced
- 1 pack Sesame flavoured Demae Ramen instant noodles
- 1 small corn on the cob
- 1 large egg
- 1 heaped teaspoon of white miso
- 1/3 packet of instant dashi (Dashinomoto)
- 1 Spring onion, sliced along the length
- 1 pat of butter

## Method

1. Piece a small hole in the bottom of the egg, place into a pan with boiled water (roughly 85<sup>o</sup>C) and bring to 
a gentle simmer for 8 minutes (I have an induction hob so put it to setting 8 out of 9). Before the time ends get a jug of
half ice, half water ready to plunge the egg into to stop the cooking process. When cold peel and set aside. 
2. Place the corn on the cob into a pan of boiling water and boil rapidly for 7 minutes. When done, drain and carefully 
slice along the length of the cob to retain a rib of corn (it doesn't matter if it falls into small pieces but it just 
looks nice as a rib).
3. Heat the grill, brush the skin of the salmon with sesame oil and place under the grill to heat up until just starting to 
burn on the skin. Keep warm. 
4. Carefully (or using an avocado peeler) slice the avocado in half, remove the stone, scoop out half the avocado and slice 
into lengths, set aside until ready to assenble. 
5. In a small jug mash the miso with some boiling water using a fork until it is dissolved, pour into a pan with the instant 
dashi and the instant packet mix from the noodle pack. Pour in about 250ml water and taste to check seasoning (add more water
if it is too salty). Drop in the noodles and on a gently boil until the noodles are cooked through. 
6. Place the noodles into a warm bowl and pour over the broth. Slice the egg in two and place nestle on the noodles. Add the 
salmon, avocado, corn ribs, spring onions and butter pat. Then sit down and enjoy!
