Rumour has it that miso ramen was first invented in Sapporo in 1953 when a drunk customer at the restaurant Aji no Sanpei asked for some noodles to be placed in his miso soup. Since then miso soup has become the famous style of Sapporo and due to their cold winters a combination of a miso tare with a tonkotsu broth is sure to warm your insides up for hours to come.
