Sapporo is the birthplace of the miso ramen. Rumour has it that a drunk man walked into a place called Aji no Sanpei in Sapporo one night and asked for noodles to be added to his miso soup and history was made. This was back in 1953 and since then this restaurant has been serving miso ramen from it’s small shop in the middle of a department store. 

Sapporo is home to a legendary place called Ganso Ramen Yokocho, which stands for “ramen alley” and is home to 17 ramen joints, all selling miso based soup with various toppings. All appear to have chashu pork as a staple, with the majority using sweetcorn, a soft boiled egg and the topping most famed for its use in ramen in Sapporo, a butter pat. Additionally some bowls contain menma (pickled bamboo shoots), others contain negi (spring onions) and a few have a sheet of nori or even some wakami seaweed. 

When it comes to noodles the thick wavy yellow noodles are the best kind for this ramen. The broth is heavy and needs something big to hang off to get the most flavour into you face and a thick crinkly noodle can do this with aplomb so you can concentrate on some meditative noodle slurping. 

When it comes to the broth we have to remember we are in the coldest part of Japan and when cold we need more fat to keep us warm, so what better broth than a good pork bone broth (tonkotsu) to fend off those cold fronts? This is miso ramen town though, so best make sure we add our miso tare to the broth to make sure it’s authentic. And finally some garlic and ginger to keep our bodies healthy and our immune systems fighting on all cylinders. 

Hokkaido is the region of Japan that produces the most dairy of any region and therefore creates the best butter, which may be the reason it is used so abundantly on their ramen.
