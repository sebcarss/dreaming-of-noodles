ingredients:
 - 1000g Organic White Flour 100.0%
 - 620g Water (25℃) 62.0%
 - 50g Unsalted Butter 5.0%
 - 20g Table Salt 2.0%
 - 15g Instant Yeast 1.5%

instructions:
 - Add flour to mixing bowl for stand mixer. 
 - Soften the butter and add to the bowl (I use a microwave for 20 seconds).
 - Add the salt to one side of the bowl and the yeast to the other.
 - Pour in the water and mix for 10 minutes using the dough hook on speed 2.
 - Take the dough out of the bowl, it should feel slightly sticky but can be shaped easily.
 - Shape it into a smooth ball and then put it in a large bowl and cover with a tea towel (or cling film) and leave for at least 1 hour. You want it to be doubled in size but it's ok if it goes larger.
 - Take the dough out of the bowl and knock it back on a lightly floured surface.
 - Split in two and then shape into a smooth ball, before doing one pull towards you from the back to squash it into a sausage/rugby ball shape.
 - Lightly grease two loaf tins with butter and then pop the dough into each one, giving them a squash with your hands to push them to the edges.
 - Cover with a tea towel, or place in a large proofing bag (I use a Le Creuset casserole dish to stop the air getting to it and a cake carrier). Leave for around 1 hour or until it is just about to bulge over the side like a mushroom. 
 - Pre-heat the oven to 210℃ and place both tins in for 30mins. 
 - Take out and cool on a wire rack.

This white tin loaf is great for sandwiches as the addition of the butter makes this lovely and soft. I always make twice the amount that I need and then wrap the second loaf in a plastic bread bag, tie with a clip and pop in the freezer for when I run out of the first loaf, which usually isn't long.
