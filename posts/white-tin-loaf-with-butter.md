This white tin loaf is great for sandwiches as the addition of the butter makes this lovely and soft. I always make twice the amount that I need and then wrap the second loaf in a plastic bread bag, tie with a clip and pop in the freezer for when I run out of the first loaf, which usually isn't long.

Method
------

1. Add flour to mixing bowl for stand mixer. 
2. Soften the butter and add to the bowl (I use a microwave for 20 seconds).
3. Add the salt to one side of the bowl and the yeast to the other.
4. Pour in the water and mix for 10 minutes using the dough hook on speed 2.
5. Take the dough out of the bowl, it should feel slightly sticky but can be shaped easily.
6. Shape it into a smooth ball and then put it in a large bowl and cover with a tea towel (or cling film) and leave for at least 1 hour. You want it to be doubled in size but it's ok if it goes larger.
7. Take the dough out of the bowl and knock it back on a lightly floured surface.
8. Split in two and then shape into a smooth ball, before doing one pull towards you from the back to squash it into a sausage/rugby ball shape.
9. Lightly grease two loaf tins with butter and then pop the dough into each one, giving them a squash with your hands to push them to the edges.
10. Cover with a tea towel, or place in a large proofing bag (I use a Le Creuset casserole dish to stop the air getting to it and a cake carrier). Leave for around 1 hour or until it is just about to bulge over the side like a mushroom. 
11. Pre-heat the oven to 210â„ƒ and place both tins in for 30mins. 
12. Take out and cool on a wire rack.
