Hokkaido is the nothern most island of Japan and is also one of the colder areas that I will visit on my tour. But with the cold weather comes a treasure trove of delicious seafood and in particular the Red King Crab, the biggest of the crab species and a reason to travel to Hokkaido on its own.

But what about the noodle scene, you ask? Well, you will not be disappointed, for in Hokkaido the different cities claim a different style of ramen: Sapporo is the birthplace of miso ramen, Asahikawa is known for its shoyu based ramen, Hakodate shows off its shio based ramen, and Muroran adds some spice with a curry based ramen.

You can tell that Hokkaido is a noodle lovers paradise when in Asahikawa there is a ramen village, which hosts 8 ramen joints in a row alongside a shrine to ramen; Sapporo has a place called Ganso Ramen Yokocho, which is better know as "Ramen Alley" as it contains a glorious 17 ramen restaurants, all selling miso ramen but with a variety of toppings; and even the New Chitose Airport has a ramen street which boasts 10 ramen shops for the weary traveller to fall into a slurpy noodle dream.

The glorious food of Hokkaido doesn't stop at ramen either! It is also home to some interesting non-noodle based creations such as, Sapporo Curry Soup, which is exactly what you expect; Ikameshi, which is squid stuffed with rice; and Ishikari Nabe, which is a type of hotpot. Hokkaido also doesn't disappoint when it comes to bread either, where a fluffy white pillowy bread is baked called Hokkaido Milk Bread, a sure hit with the kids.

Welcome to Hokkaido!
